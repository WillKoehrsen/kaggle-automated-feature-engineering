      "source": "# Introduction: Automated Feature Engineering Basics\n\nIn this notebook, we will walk through applying automated feature engineering to the [Home Credit Default Risk dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) using the featuretools library. [Featuretools](https://docs.featuretools.com/) is an open-source Python package for automatically creating new features from multiple tables of structured, related data. It is ideal tool for problems such as the Home Credit Default Risk competition where there are several related tables that need to be combined into a single dataframe for training (and one for testing). \n\n## Feature Engineering\n\nThe objective of [feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) is to create new features (alos called explantory variables or predictors) to represent as much information from an entire dataset in one table.  Typically, this process is done by hand using pandas operations such as `groupby`, `agg`, or `merge` and can be very tedious. Moreover, manual feature engineering is limited both by human time constraints and imagination: we simply cannot conceive of every possible feature that will be useful. (For an example of using manual feature engineering, check out [part one](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering) and [part two](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering-p2) applied to this competition). The importance of creating the proper features cannot be overstated because a machine learning model can only learn from the data we give to it. Extracting as much information as possible from the available datasets is crucial to creating an effective solution.\n\n[Automated feature engineering](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-feature-engineering-in-python-99baf11cc219) aims to help the data scientist with the problem of feature creation by automatically building hundreds or thousands of new features from a dataset. Featuretools - the only library for automated feature engineering at the moment - will not replace the data scientist, but it will allow her to focus on more valuable parts of the machine learning pipeline, such as delivering robust models into production. \n\nHere we will touch on the concepts of automated feature engineering with featuretools and show how to implement it for the Home Credit Default Risk competition. We will stick to the basics so we can get the ideas down and then build upon this foundation in later work when we customize featuretools. We will work with a subset of the data because this is a computationally intensive job that is outside the capabilities of the Kaggle kernels. I took the work done in this notebook and ran the methods on the entire dataset with the results [available here](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/home-credit-default-risk-feature-tools). At the end of this notebook, we'll look at the features themselves, as well as the results of modeling with different combinations of hand designed and automatically built features. \n\nIf you are new to this competition, I suggest checking out [this post to get started](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction). For a good take on why features are so important, here's a [blog post](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/secret-to-data-science-success/) by one of the developers of Featuretools. "

The objective is to use historical financial and socioeconomic data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. This is a standard supervised classification task:\n\n* __Supervised__: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features\n* __Classification__: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe data is provided by [Home Credit](http://www.homecredit.net/about-us.aspx), a service dedicated to provided lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population. \n\nThere are 7 different data files:\n\n* __application_train/application_test__: the main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the `SK_ID_CURR`. The training application data comes with the `TARGET` with indicating 0: the loan was repaid and 1: the loan was not repaid. \n* __bureau__: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau and is identified by the `SK_ID_BUREAU`, Each loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n* __bureau_balance__: monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length. \n* __previous_application__: previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_PREV`. \n* __POS_CASH_BALANCE__: monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n* __credit_card_balance__: monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n* __installments_payment__: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. \n\nThe diagram below (provided by Home Credit) shows how the tables are related. This will be very useful when we need to define relationships in featuretools. \n\n![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/home-credit/home_credit.png)\n\n### Read in Data and Create Small Datasets\n\nWe will read in the full dataset, sort by the `SK_ID_CURR` and keep only the first 1000 rows to make the calculations feasible. Later we can convert to a script and run with the entire datasets."

Automated feature engineering, like many topics in machine learning, is a complex subject built upon a foundation of simpler ideas. By going through these ideas one at a time, we can build up our understanding of how featuretools which will later allow for us to get the most out of it.\n\nThere are a few concepts that we will cover along the way:\n\n* [Entities and EntitySets](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html)\n* [Relationships between tables](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html#adding-a-relationship)\n* [Feature primitives](https://docs.featuretools.com/automated_feature_engineering/primitives.html): aggregations and transformations\n* [Deep feature synthesis](https://docs.featuretools.com/automated_feature_engineering/afe.html)\n\n# Entities and Entitysets\n\nAn entity is simply a table or in Pandas, a `dataframe`. The observations are in the rows and the features in the columns. An entity in featuretools must have a unique index where none of the elements are duplicated.  Currently, only `app`, `bureau`, and `previous` have unique indices (`SK_ID_CURR`, `SK_ID_BUREAU`, and `SK_ID_PREV` respectively). For the other dataframes, we must pass in `make_index = True` and then specify the name of the index. Entities can also have time indices where each entry is identified by a unique time. (There are not datetimes in any of the data, but there are relative times, given in months or days, that we could consider treating as time variables).\n\nAn [EntitySet](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html) is a collection of tables and the relationships between them. This can be thought of a data structute with its own methods and attributes. Using an EntitySet allows us to group together multiple tables and manipulate them much quicker than individual tables. \n\nFirst we'll make an empty entityset named clients to keep track of all the data."

The children can then have multiple children of their own. In a _parent table_, each individual has a single row. Each individual in the parent table can have multiple rows in the _child table_. \n\nAs an example, the `app` dataframe has one row for each client  (`SK_ID_CURR`) while the `bureau` dataframe has multiple previous loans (`SK_ID_PREV`) for each parent (`SK_ID_CURR`). Therefore, the `bureau` dataframe is the child of the `app` dataframe.

An aggregation works across multiple tables using relationships between tables.\n* __Transformation__: an operation applied to one or more columns in a single table. An example would be taking the absolute value of a column, or finding the difference between two columns in one table.\n\nA list of the available features primitives in featuretools can be viewed below."

      "source": "# Deep Feature Synthesis\n\nDeep Feature Synthesis (DFS) is the process featuretools uses to make new features. DFS stacks feature primitives to form features with a \"depth\" equal to the number of primitives. For example, if we take the maximum value of a client's previous loans (say `MAX(previous.loan_amount)`), that is a \"deep feature\" with a depth of 1. To create a feature with a depth of two, we could stack primitives by taking the maximum value of a client's average montly payments per previous loan (such as `MAX(previous(MEAN(installments.payment)))`). The [original paper on automated feature engineering using deep feature synthesis](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf) is worth a read. \n\nTo perform DFS in featuretools, we use the `dfs`  function passing it an `entityset`, the `target_entity` (where we want to make the features), the `agg_primitives` to use, the `trans_primitives` to use and the `max_depth` of the features. Here we will use the default aggregation and transformation primitives,  a max depth of 2, and calculate primitives for the `app` entity. Because this process is computationally expensive, we can run the function using `features_only = True` to return only a list of the features and not calculate the features themselves. This can be useful to look at the resulting features before starting an extended computation."

When I did feature engineering by hand, it took about 12 hours to create a comparable size dataset. However, while we get a lot of features in featuretools, this function call is not very well-informed. We simply used the default aggregations without thinking about which ones are \"important\" for the problem. We end up with a lot of features, but they are probably not all relevant to the problem. Too many irrelevant features can decrease performance by drowning out the important features (related to the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality))\n\nThe next call we make will specify a smaller set of features. We still are not using much domain knowledge, but this feature set will be more manageable. The next step from here is improving the features we actually build and performing feature selection."

      "source": "## Feature Performance Experiments\n\nTo compare a number of different feature sets for the machine learning task, I set up several experiments.. In order to isolate the effect of the features, the same model was used to test a number of different feature sets. The model (which can be viewed in the appendix) is a basic LightGBM algorithm using 5-fold cross validation for training and evaluation. First, we establish a control dataset, and then we carry out a series of experiments and present the results.\n\n* Control: using only data from the `application` dataset\n* Test One: manual feature engineering using only the `application`, `bureau` and `bureau_balance` data\n* Test Two: manual feature engineering using all datasets\n* Test Three: featuretools default features (in the `feature_matrix`)\n* Test Four: featuretools specified features (in the `feature_matrix_spec`)\n* Test Five: featuretools specified features combined with manual feature engineering \n\nThe number of features is after one-hot encoding, the validation receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) is calculated using 5-fold cross validation, the test ROC AUC is from the public leaderboard, and the time spent designing is my best estimate of how long it took to make the dataset! \n\n| Test    | Number of Features | Validation ROC AUC | Test ROC AUC | Time Spent |\n|---------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------|\n| Control | 241                |           0.760         |     0.745         |       0.25 hours  |\n| One     | 421                |       0.766             |      0.757        |        8 hours        |\n| Two     |      1465             |          0.785          |         0.783     |                 12 hours |\n| Three   | 1803               |      0.784              |       0.777       |               1 hour\n| Four    | 1156               |         0.786           |        0.779      |                 1.25 hours |\n| Five    |  1624                  |           0. 787        |      0.782        |                    13.25 hours |\n\n\nIt's hard to say which set is exactly the best (although I trust the cross validation scores more than the public leaderboard) but there are huge discrepancies is the time for development. The specified featuretools dataset was able to achieve nearly the same performance as the hand engineered features on the test set with 8% of the time invested. It's clear that featuretools delivered value on this problem, but it still did not leave us without a job. The vital role of the data scientist now comes down to choosing the correct set of primitives and selecting the best features from among all the candidates. "

When we look at correlations with the target, we need to be careful about the [multiple comparisons problem](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-multiple-comparisons-problem-e5573e8b9578): if we make a ton of features, some are likely to be correlated with the target simply because of random noise. Using correlations is fine as a first approximation for identifying \"good features\", but it is not a rigorous feature selection method.  \n\nAlso, based on examining some of the features, it seems there might be issues with [collinearity between features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) made by featuretools. Features that are highly correlated with one another can diminish interpretability and generalization performance on the test set. In an ideal scenario, we would have a set of independent features, but that rarely occurs in practice. If there are very highly correlated varibables, we might want to think about removing some of them.\n\nFor the correlations, we will focus on the `feature_matrix_spec`, the features we made by specifying the primitives. The same analysis could be applied to the default feature set. These correlations were calculated using the entire training section of the feature matrix."

This shows the distribution of a single variable, and can be thought of as a smoothed histogram. To show the effect of a categorical variable on the distribution of a numeric variable, we can color the plot by th value of the categorical variable. In the plot below, we show the distribution of two of the newly created features, colored by the value of the target. \n\nFirst, we read in some of the feature matrix using the `nrows` argument of pandas `read_csv` function. This ensures we will not read in the entire 2 GB file. "

The maximum of this value (over the previous loans) is therefore represented by this feature. We also see several important features with a depth of two such as `MEAN(previous_app.MIN(installments.AMT_PAYMENT))` which is the average over a client's loans of the minimum value of previous credit application installment payments. \n\nFeature importances can be used for dimensionality reduction. They can also be used to help us better understand a problem. For example, we could use the most important features in order to concentrate on these aspects of a client when evaluating a potential loan. Let's look at the number of features with 0 importance which almost certainly can be removed from the featureset. "

Although we did not use the advanced functionality of featuretools, we still were able to create useful features that improved the model's performance in cross validation and on the test set. Moreover, automated feature engineering took a fraction of the time spent manual feature engineering while delivering comparable results. \n\n__Even the default set of features in featuretools was able to achieve similar performance to hand-engineered features in less than 10% of the time.__\n__Featuretools demonstrably adds value when included in a data scientist's toolbox.__\n\nThe next steps are to take advantage of the advanced functionality in featuretools combined with domain knowledge to create a more useful set of features. We will look explore [tuning featuretools in an upcoming notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/intro-to-tuning-automated-feature-engineering)!"
